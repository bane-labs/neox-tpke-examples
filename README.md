# NeoX TPKE Examples

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that demonstrates the usage of the [neox-tpke](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neox-tpke) library for threshold public key encryption on the NeoX blockchain.

## Features

- Examples of TPKE (Threshold Public Key Encryption) operations
- Integration with NeoX blockchain
- Modern React/Next.js interface with Tailwind CSS
- Web3 wallet integration using RainbowKit and Wagmi

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:
